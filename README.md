# Leather-Defect-Detection-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
 This project develops a deep learning model using RetinaNet with a YOLO v8 Backbone to detect defects in leather. By training on a dataset of annotated leather images, the model aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of quality assessment in the footwear industry.
